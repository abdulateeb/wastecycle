## WASTE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATED SORTING IN MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES


## Project Overview
This project aims to build an intelligent machine learning model to classify waste into seven categories — Cardboard, E-Waste, Glass, Medical, Metal, Paper, and Plastic — by analyzing images of waste materials.
The goal is to implement this system into Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs) to replace manual waste sorting with an automated real-time classification system working over a conveyor belt.

## Modules

- **Data Processing and Preprocessing**  
  Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.

- **Model Training**  
  Training a machine learning model to classify images into the 7 categories.

- **Web Application Deployment**  
  Streamlit-based webapp for testing model where users can upload and classify waste images.

- **Evaluation and Testing**  
  Real-world testing on unseen data with accuracy.
